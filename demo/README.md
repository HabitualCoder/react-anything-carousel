# Demo App

This Vite-powered demo showcases different ways to compose `react-anything-carousel` with custom content.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run demo:install
npm run demo:dev
```

The commands above install the demo dependencies and launch the dev server on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run demo:dev` – start the demo locally with hot reloading.
- `npm run demo:build` – produce a production-ready build under `demo/dist`.
- `npm run demo:preview` – preview the production build locally.

## Deployment

Deploy the contents of `demo/dist` to Vercel (or another static host). The production build automatically bundles the library from the root workspace through the file dependency declared in `demo/package.json`.
